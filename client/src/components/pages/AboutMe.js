                Self-motivated full-stack developer with an IT background and an
                eagerness to empower others. Recently earned a certificate in
                full-stack web development from the University of New Hampshire,

                Known as a go-getter, I believe in self-advocacy and making the
                most out of a situation. With each project I've worked on, Iâ€™ve
                utilized newly learned concepts from prior classes and previous
                projects. I applied Agile methodologies on In-Progress projects to
                keep my projects up to date. I worked on a team of four to develop
                a hiking app that provides current popular hiking trial data,
                weather forecasts, and a dynamic map for users to view in any area
                across the US.

                My educational and professional background in
                technology, combined with a passionate drive to effectively solve
                problems, would make me a strong addition to any organization.
